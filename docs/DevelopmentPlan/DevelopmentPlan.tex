%\wss{Put your introductory blurb here.  Often the blurb is a brief roadmap of
%what is contained in the report.}

\section{Development Plan Overview}
The development plan for \progname{} outlines how our team will organize, develop, 
nd deliver an AI-based system to identify cows by their black-white patterns on their back 
and detect potential health issues. This document includes our Confidential information, 
IP to protect, Copyright license, Team meeting plan, Team communication plan, Team member 
roles, Workflow plan, Project decomposition and scheduling, Proof of concept demonstration 
plan, Expected technology, and Coding standard.

\wss{Additional information on the development plan can be found in the
\href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/courses/capstone/-/blob/main/Lectures/L02b_POCAndDevPlan/POCAndDevPlan.pdf?ref_type=heads}
{lecture slides}.}

\section{Confidential Information?}

%\wss{State whether your project has confidential information from industry, or
%not.  If there is confidential information, point to the agreement you have in
%place.}
%\wss{For most teams this section will just state that there is no confidential
%information to protect.}

Our project does not involve confidential information from industry. 
All data and models will be based on publicly available datasets or 
collected in compliance with open-source or academic research guidelines.

\section{IP to Protect}

%\wss{State whether there is IP to protect.  If there is, point to the agreement.
%All students who are working on a project that requires an IP agreement are also
%required to sign the ``Intellectual Property Guide Acknowledgement.''}

There is no proprietary intellectual property (IP) to protect for this project. 
The outputs will be published under an open-source license to encourage 
collaboration and reproducibility.

\section{Copyright License}

%\wss{What copyright license is your team adopting.  Point to the license in your
%repo.}

The team has chosen the MIT License, which will be included in the GitHub 
repository. This license provides flexibility for others to use, modify, 
and distribute the project with proper attribution.


\section{Team Meeting Plan}

%\wss{How often will you meet? where?}

%\wss{If the meeting is a physical location (not virtual), out of an abundance of
%caution for safety reasons you shouldn't put the location online}

%\wss{How often will you meet with your industry advisor?  when?  where?}

%\wss{Will meetings be virtual?  At least some meetings should likely be
%in-person.}

%\wss{How will the meetings be structured?  There should be a chair for all meetings.  There should be an agenda for all meetings.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Team check-in meetings will be held twice weekly via Microsoft Teams or Zoom, all team members are expected to attend
  and share their progress.
  \item An in-person meeting will be scheduled at least once per month on campus.
  \item The industry advisor will meet with the team weekly, virtually. Including check-in and Q&A.
  \item Each meeting will have a designated chair and note-taker, with an agenda shared in advance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

%\wss{Issues on GitHub should be part of your communication plan.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Primary communication will be through MS Teams for quick messages and updates.
  \item Email will be used for formal communications and sharing important documents.
  \item Regular progress will be shared in a dedicated GitHub repository.
  \item GitHub Issues will be used to track lecture attendance, tasks, bugs, and feature requests.
  \item A shared file folder on MS Teams will be used for collaborative document editing and storage.
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Member Roles}

% \wss{You should identify the types of roles you anticipate, like notetaker,
% leader, meeting chair, reviewer.  Assigning specific people to those roles is
% not necessary at this stage.  In a student team the role of the individuals will
% likely change throughout the year.}

Every team member is responsible for attending meetings, replying to messages, creating issues, coding, testing,
reviewing code, and documentation.  In addition, team members will take on
the following rotating roles:

\subsection*{Meeting Chair}
Leads meetings and ensures meetings stay on track.
Every team member will take turns being the chair.

\subsection*{Note-Taker}
Records meeting minutes, captures action items, and distributes notes to the team.
Every team member will take turns being the note-taker.

\subsection*{Reviewer}
Reviews code contributions, provides feedback, and ensures coding standards are met.
Zongcheng Li, Ji Zhang and Baoning Zhang will primarily take on this role, but all team members are encouraged to participate in code reviews.

\subsection*{Integrator}
Merges code contributions, resolves conflicts, and ensures the codebase remains stable.
Changhao Wu and Zongcheng Li will primarily take on this role, but all team members are

\subsection*{Lead Developer}
Oversees the technical direction of the AI/ML pipeline, coordinates integration 
between modules, and supports other members in debugging and implementation.
Changhao Wu and Zongcheng Li will primarily take on this role, but all team members are encouraged to contribute to technical decisions.
All team members will contribute to development tasks.

\subsection*{Communication Lead}
Prepare agendas, manages communication with the industry advisor, schedules meetings, and ensures
Zongcheng Li and Changhao Wu will primarily take on this role, but all team members are encouraged to participate in communication tasks.

\section{Workflow Plan}

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item How will you be using git, including branches, pull request, etc.?
% 	\item How will you be managing issues, including template issues, issue
% 	classification, etc.?
%   \item Use of CI/CD
% \end{itemize}
The following workflow will be adopted for the project:
1. Pull any changes from the main branch to ensure the local repository is up-to-date.
2. Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix, following the naming convention `feature/feature-name` or `bugfix/bug-name`.
3. Create a draft of the structure of the code/documentation. 
4. Implement the functions without dependencies first, then the functions with dependencies.
5. Commit changes frequently with clear, descriptive messages.
6. Push the branch to the remote repository on GitHub.
7. Open a pull request (PR) to merge the feature/bugfix branch into the main branch.
8. Assign at least one team member as a reviewer for the PR.
9. Address any feedback from the reviewer(s) and make necessary changes.
10. Once approved, the PR will be merged into the main branch.
11. Delete the feature/bugfix branch after merging to keep the repository clean.
12. Use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests, with appropriate labels for classification.
13. Update any changes in the weekly check-in meetings.


\section{Project Decomposition and Scheduling}

\begin{itemize}
  \item How will you be using GitHub projects?
  \item Include a link to your GitHub project
\end{itemize}

\wss{How will the project be scheduled?  This is the big picture schedule, not
details. You will need to reproduce information that is in the course outline
for deadlines.}

\section{Proof of Concept Demonstration Plan}

What is the main risk, or risks, for the success of your project?  What will you
demonstrate during your proof of concept demonstration to convince yourself that
you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Expected Technology}

\wss{What programming language or languages do you expect to use?  What external
libraries?  What frameworks?  What technologies.  Are there major components of
the implementation that you expect you will implement, despite the existence of
libraries that provide the required functionality.  For projects with machine
learning, will you use pre-trained models, or be training your own model?  }

\wss{The implementation decisions can, and likely will, change over the course
of the project.  The initial documentation should be written in an abstract way;
it should be agnostic of the implementation choices, unless the implementation
choices are project constraints.  However, recording our initial thoughts on
implementation helps understand the challenge level and feasibility of a
project.  It may also help with early identification of areas where project
members will need to augment their training.}

Topics to discuss include the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific libraries
\item Pre-trained models
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
\item Tools you will likely be using?
\end{itemize}

\wss{git, GitHub and GitHub projects should be part of your technology.}

\section{Coding Standard}

\wss{What coding standard will you adopt?}
