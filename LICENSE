In terms of Copyright License, CATTLEytics software is not open-source, so general licenses like that do not apply.
Our platforms are also cloud-based (SaaS), so they're not usually "licensed" because the code is not downloaded or installed by the user.
This is where you have "Terms of Service" rather than a copyright license.

By creating an account or accessing any services of CATTLEytics Inc.,
you are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable,
revocable license to access and use the platform solely for your
internal business purposes, subject to these Terms of Service.

You may not:
- Copy, modify, or create derivative works of the platform;
- Attempt to reverse engineer or gain unauthorized access;
- Use the platform to provide competing services;
- Redistribute or resell access without permission.
